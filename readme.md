# Controlled Forms - Acme Note Taker

You'll be making the frontend for a note-taking app where you can create, archive/unarchive, & delete notes.

Several parts have been supplied for you in order to get you working on some of the related work.

**HOWEVER,** you should be able to explain all the code supplied. Before even starting to write your own code, make sure you take a look at everything given and make sure it makes sense. Consult with your partner to make sure everyone is on the same page.

If something isn't making sense, make a help ticket or reach out! Starting to code without understanding the skeleton will lead to issues since you may be over-doing or under-doing some parts. Look at the code with a critical eye and see what's being passed where, what's doing what, and why is stuff doing what.
